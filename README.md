# Ghost_Goblin_boo
Python program for the Ghost, Goblin, and Boo kernel problem, which utilizes KNN, SVM, and NN algorithms. The program aims to classify images of three distinct entities: Ghost, Goblin, and Boo, using machine learning algorithms.

The KNN algorithm is implemented for image classification by measuring the distance between the pixel values of images, while the SVM algorithm uses a kernel function to create a decision boundary between the three entities. Additionally, the NN algorithm is used for feature extraction, where a deep learning model is trained to learn the features of the images and classify them accordingly.

The program has been designed with a user-friendly interface that allows the user to upload images and observe the classification results. The program also includes features for evaluating the accuracy of the model's predictions.

Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming and my ability to apply machine learning algorithms to solve complex image classification problems.
